# TSP Ship Routing with Fuel & CO₂ Tracking

This project uses a Genetic Algorithm (via [PyGAD](https://github.com/ahmedfgad/GeneticAlgorithmPython)) to solve a **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** for a passenger ship.  
The algorithm finds the most fuel-efficient route between multiple ports, while also tracking **distance**, **fuel consumption**, and **CO₂ emissions** over generations.

## Features
- Optimizes a single ship route (TSP) using GA.
- Calculates route distance, fuel consumption, and CO₂ emissions.
- Plots the change in distance, fuel, and CO₂ per generation.
- Easy to adapt for other ship routing scenarios.

## Requirements
Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
